# Did Fandango Adjust Its Ratings?  

## Overview  
This project analyzes Fandango's movie ratings for 2015 and 2016 to identify whether there were changes in their rating system. Using Python and data visualization tools, the analysis explores trends and differences in the ratings' distribution.

## Goals  
1. Compare movie ratings between 2015 and 2016 to identify shifts.  
2. Use statistical metrics (mean, median, mode) for precise insights.  
3. Visualize and interpret differences in ratings distributions.

## Key Findings  
- **Kernel Density Plots**: Showed a left-skewed distribution for both years, with a slight left shift in 2016.  
- **Summary Statistics**: Mean and mode were lower in 2016, indicating slightly lower ratings.  
- Ratings for 2016 were less clustered around high values compared to 2015.

## Tools and Libraries  
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

## Project Structure  
- **Data**: Includes cleaned datasets for 2015 and 2016.  
- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis.  
- **Visualizations**: Kernel density plots and bar charts comparing metrics.
